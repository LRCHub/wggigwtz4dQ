Stop it, stop it, stop it
"How are you so stupid,"
Screams a piece of me I lost along with my MORALITY
Darlin', baby, darlin'
Got me going crazy
Livin' giddy on the daily, that's just my PHILOSOPHY

Look into my eyes, you're cuter each time
Deadly as a devil, losin' my mind
Caught in your delusion
Gone before I knew it
Baby, there's a magic in the way that you lie

Sick of feelin' lovesick, you're the one to blame
Burning, burning, but I love it when you enter my veins
Watch my love for you spew from these arteries
IRIS OUT

Now I don't know what these feelings are
Don't know anything anymore
All your lovely nothings bubble up into my throat (BOOM)
Both eyes open wide as I'm watching hell unfold
You're my one and only answer, baby
Hold me close

(Darling, darling)
(Darling, darling)
(Darling, darling)
(Darling, darling)

Can't catch a break even if I died
Playing by the rules doesn't suit your kind
Tangled in your web, no escapin' those eyes
You're topping each time

Smile so cute when you fling your AVADA KEDAVRA
Arrow to the heart, but know I really loved ya
Stick it in me
'Til I can't breathe
Is it hurting?

Look into my eyes, you're cuter each time
Deadly as a devil, losin' my mind
Caught in your delusion
Gone before I knew it
Baby, there's a magic in the way that you lie

Tell me darling, was it all fake?
Either way, it doesn't matter, I'll come begging all the same
Watch my love for you spew from these arteries
I-I-I-I-IRIS OUT

I-I-I-I-IRIS OUT

I-I-I-I-IRIS OUT
Now I don't know what these feelings are
Don't know anything anymore
All your lovely nothings bubble up into my throat (BOOM)
Both eyes open wide as I'm watching hell unfold
You're my one and only answer, baby
Hold me close

(Darling, darling)
(Darling, darling)
(Darling, darling)
(Darling, darling)
